- 👋 Hi, I’m @skriptmonkey
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development, Web Development, Data Science/ML, Linux, and Open Source technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science on Kaggle.com. I'm also learning to create games using the Godot Engine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games, websites using Django or WagtailCMS, almost anything involving Linux, Python, or GDScript (Godot).
